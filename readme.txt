== Description ==

Add a bunch of quotes on the backend, and randomly (or specifically)
generate them on a widget, with shortcodes, or elsewhere in your theme.

This plugin is a fork of Perfect Quotes. I forked it because it's an excellent
plugin. Differences:

=== Additions ===
* Rich text editor for the quote
* 'Featured Image' functionality for thumbnails of the author

=== Subtractions ===
* Removed 'Action Button'
* Simplified shortcode
* Don't support showing multiple quotes
* Don't support metadata

= Features =

* Widget based to easily place your quotes where you like.
* A custom shortcode is included if you want to place your quotes within a post or a page.
* Based on Custom Post types with its own admin menu.

= Support languages =
* PHP
* CSS
* jQuery/javascript

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the Imperfect Quotes menu and select Add new.
4. Type in the author.
5. Type in the quote.

It will look something like this:

The trouble with quotes on the internet is that
itâ€™s difficult to discern whether or not they are genuine.
- Abraham Lincoln

= Widget =

1. Include the widget by going to Appearance > Widgets.
2. Drag the Imperfect Quotes widget to the area of your choice.
3. Give your widget a custom title if you wish.

= Shortcode =

From any page or post, you can add shortcode to display all your quotes.

From the Imperfect Quotes home area, there is a column called Shortcode.
Find the particular quote you want and copy the corresponding shortcode.
It looks something like [imperfect_quotes id="1"].
Paste this into your post or onto a page and your quote will magically appear!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the custom fields that I can use? =

Imperfect Quotes doesn't support custom fields. You'll want to use
Perfect Quotes for that.

= Does your plugin have a feature to randomly select quotes? =

Unless you specify the quote by its id, it'll be randomly selected.
